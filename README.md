# Personal Web

Hello, welcome to my web repository. This is a simple one-page web that I made to show my work experience and my skills. You are free to use this web as a template for your web. I hope you enjoy it!

## How to use

The only file you need to edit is `src/routes/+page.svelte`. The page is written in HTML + TailwindCSS but you do not need to know TailwindCSS to edit it. Any changes to the hierarchy of the HTML elements can break the flow of the web, be cautious and be sure to know what you are doing.

## How to run

If you want to see changes while coding run `npm run dev`.

If you want to build your final web run `npm run build`.

## How to deploy

This repository is ready to be automatically deployed on Vercel using the SvelteKit v1 template. You can deploy it on any other platform but you will need to configure it yourself in `svelte.config.js`.
